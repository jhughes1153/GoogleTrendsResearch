# GoogleTrends
A project exploring google trends and stock prices

# GoogleTrendsSpy
A project that will explore the ability to predict the spy based on keywords, it currently only uses fixed keywords but a generator will later be made to get the best ones, the issue will be backfilling data but but daily data is all I can currently get and backfilled weekly is the best I can get for that. Eventually it will be tuned with machine learning to try to predict the stock market maybe with an ode neural net.
