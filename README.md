# PythonProjects
These are just some python codes I was messing with, the first one is basically a program that I wrote
in a lab but converted to python as I was trying to learn python. The second folder is a python
project I was working on where we were trying to collect stock data and be visualize it, but we only
wanted it for certain dates, so the second one is a reflection of that code.
